    description: "We actively engaged in executing essential site engineering surveying tasks for Lindner Prater Ltd. Our primary objective was to ensure the seamless installation of critical elements, including roofing, internal/external cladding, and escalator glazing and platform soffits, situated directly above the bustling railway tracks. This project has posed a significant challenge in terms of precision. Our team has conducted survey works to highlight and identify any potential tolerance issues. Additionally, we have conducted thorough surveys of interfaces to proactively highlight and navigate potential challenges. We had to adapt to the dynamic demands of the site, with our team of engineering surveyors working tirelessly days and nights over the past year to meet the tight schedule of the project.",
