    description: "Working along the steel frame contractor Severfield, our engineers located components for the steel frame for this flagship project overlooking Piccadilly Circus, including complex roof cassettes that enveloped the building in an innovative design. Many of the cassettes cascaded down the sides of the building, becoming features of multiple floors below. The connection plates between these cassettes and the structure were angled and sloped in many different directions to fit the complex shapes together, requiring three dimensional surveys to be done and 3D drawings to be produved showing their positions relative to design in all planes. Some party walls on the perimeter of the building were listed brickwork and required very minimal modifications to accommodate large steel beams and columns being connected into them, this took precision surveying before and after connection to ensure the existing and new structures levels or integrity were not affected. With many obstacles and re-designs on this project it was critical that onsite information was accurate and relayed as quickly as possible to design teams to avoid delays and additional costs to the project.",

    description: "We played a pivotal role in the construction of the new £1 billion Google Headquarters in Kings Cross, London. Serving as the lead engineers for the steel frame contractor, our managing director led the project for multiple years during the main construction phase. Supported by a dedicated team of engineers, we oversaw every aspect of the steel frame installation, ensuring precise positioning and alignment of every structural element. As the project progressed, our involvement extended beyond the steel framework to include positioning over 30 precast concrete architectural stairs, seamlessly integrating them into the expansive roof garden and walkways surrounding the building's envelope. Our meticulous attention to detail and commitment to excellence contributed to the successful completion of this iconic project, cementing our reputation as industry leaders in engineering innovation and execution.",

    description: "Regal's The Clarendon project in Watford, a distinguished high-rise residential development, was successfully supported by PF Geomatics over the past year. Our dedicated team of engineering surveyors collaborated closely with the Regal team, playing a pivotal role in overseeing the concrete subcontractor's work. The Clarendon, featuring 168 private residences and amenities such as a 25th-floor sky garden, concierge services, a cinema, and a gymnasium, stands as a cornerstone of Watford’s regeneration efforts. Our responsibilities encompassed conducting rigorous quality checks and rebar inspections, as well as carrying out pre-pour and post-pour surveys crucial for maintaining the tight tolerances required for the cladding works. These surveys ensured that the structure’s slab edges and facade brackets met the precise specifications necessary for successful cladding installation. By overseeing general surveying and setting out verifications, our team ensured that all aspects of the construction adhered to the highest standards, contributing significantly to constructing The Clarendon to the required quality and specifications. This project highlights PF Geomatics` commitment to excellence and our ability to meet complex challenges in urban development.",

    description: "This flagship project directly opposite Westminster Abbey consisted a rennovation of an 8 storey RC frame building with two additional steel frame floors added to the roof. The original open atrium in the centre of the building was filled in with steel beams and columns on every level to increase floor area and usable office space for future tenants. The building style was listed and surrounded on either side with Victoria St and Tothill St, making it a complex and high security job with a sensitive public boundary. Our engineers set up primary and secondary control for the project, created the grid system to datums best fit the original structure, carry out high detail surveys of all existing components on every floor for the designers and architects to work to, set-out position and level of new steel members and building strengthening works throughout the project. We worked closely with the site team to detect design clashes before elements were installed and were continuously relaying new information to the designers and client as the demolition of obsolete existing structure was being done.

    description: "This large rennovation project of 5 buildings a short walk from Victoria tube station required detailed surveys of all existing structural and non-structural brickwork and RC walls. The buildings were originally residential with lots of small rooms with between 5 and 7 levels in each. This meant the surveys required lots of transferred control and instrument setups to complete to a high standard and many months of continuous surveying to get the information to the design teams in good time. Each building had one to two steel frame levels added to the roof so steel components and strengthening works needed to be set out to a high degree of precision to fit the existing structure. Our engineers worked tirelessly alongside the main contractor to collect data and release detailed drawings to ensure designers and other contractors had the information required to keep working and avoid any costly delays.",

    description: "This project right next to the Elizabeth line entrance at Paddington Station comprised the strengthening of an existing 5 level RC building and adding two steel frame levels to the top. Our engineers had to survey every RC component of the existing structure and relay this information to the site and design teams. This building being over 70m long and each floor containing hundreds of columns made it a challenging task requiring lots of internal and external control points and setups to achieve. Our engineers also set-out the steel frame on top by marking the precise locations of the existing RC columns from the floor below to ensure the new load was transferred most effectively through the existing structure.",
